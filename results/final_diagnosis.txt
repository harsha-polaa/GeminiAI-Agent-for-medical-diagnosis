### Final Diagnosis:

**Team Consensus:  Likely Panic Disorder, with Secondary Considerations**

After reviewing the reports from the cardiologist, psychologist, and pulmonologist, our team concurs that the most likely diagnosis for Mr. Johnson's symptoms is **panic disorder**. The extensive negative cardiac workup (normal ECG, cardiac enzymes, Holter monitor, echocardiogram) strongly supports this conclusion.  The symptoms align perfectly with classic panic attack presentations, and his history of anxiety further strengthens this diagnosis.

**Key Findings:**

* **Consistent Symptom Presentation:** All three reports highlight the episodic nature of Mr. Johnson's chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and diaphoresis, aligning with a panic attack profile.  The duration (10-20 minutes) and description (including impending doom) are typical.

* **Negative Cardiac Workup:** The cardiologist's comprehensive evaluation definitively rules out significant cardiac pathology as the primary cause.

* **Anxiety as a Primary Driver:** The psychologist emphasizes the strong link between Mr. Johnson's symptoms and his pre-existing anxiety disorder.  The fear of a heart attack, a common feature of panic disorder, likely exacerbates the anxiety cycle.

* **Pulmonary Concerns – Secondary Role:** While the pulmonologist raises the possibility of hyperventilation associated with panic attacks and the influence of GERD, these are considered secondary factors, exacerbating existing symptoms rather than being primary causes.  There's no evidence of significant underlying pulmonary disease.

**Recommendations:**

Our team recommends a multidisciplinary approach, focusing on managing Mr. Johnson's panic disorder while addressing secondary concerns:

1. **Prioritize Panic Disorder Management:**  This should be the central focus of treatment. The recommendations from the psychologist regarding comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, CBT for panic disorder (including interoceptive exposure), and optimized medication management (SSRIs or SNRIs instead of PRN benzodiazepines) are crucial.

2. **Address Secondary Concerns:**

    * **GERD Management:**  The pulmonologist’s concerns regarding GERD should be addressed, potentially through reassessment of his PPI regimen and consideration of a 24-hour esophageal pH study if symptoms persist.

    * **Hyperventilation Monitoring:**  While ABG measurement during an attack might be helpful,  it's less crucial than addressing the underlying panic disorder.  Education on breathing techniques may be beneficial.

    * **Stress Management:**  The cardiologist's recommendation for stress management techniques (yoga, meditation) is strongly supported.  Addressing the high-stress nature of his job should be encouraged.


3. **Regular Follow-up:** Close monitoring of Mr. Johnson's symptoms is essential to ensure that his anxiety is effectively managed and that any new or concerning developments are promptly addressed.  Regular appointments with both his psychiatrist and primary care physician are recommended.

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Testing:**  While the pulmonologist suggested further pulmonary tests, these should only be considered *if* there's insufficient improvement after addressing the anxiety and GERD, and only after a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the low likelihood of finding a significant pulmonary cause.


**Prognosis:**

With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is excellent.  Mr. Johnson is expected to experience significant symptom reduction and improved quality of life with a comprehensive approach targeting his panic disorder and addressing secondary contributors.  Early intervention and consistent adherence to the treatment plan are key.
